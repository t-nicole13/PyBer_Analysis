# PyBer_Analysis

## Original Objective

- Goal: Improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
- Tasks:
    - Analyze all ride-share date at PyBer from Jan to early May 2019.
    - Create a visualization of my findings.

## New Objective   
- Tasks
    - Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
    - Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. (Pandas, Matplotlib)
    - Submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by the decision-makers at PyBer.

- Deliverable 1: groupby(), count(), map(), sum()
- Deliverable 2: object-oriented interface method, annotations, groupby(), sum(), pivot(), resample()
- Deliverable 3: README.md

## Resources

- Libraries: Matplotlib 3.5.0 (graphing), Numpy 1.20.3 (numerical mathematics), Pandas 1.3.5 (data analysis), SciPy 1.7.3 (mathematical computing)
- Sofware: Python 3.7.11, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
- city_data.csv
- ride_data.csv
- PyBer_ride_data.csv

## Original Results
- Statistical Analysis by City Type
    - Urban cities have the highest driver, rider, and fare count. However, rural cities have a higher average fare.
    - Rural cities have the lowest driver, rider, and fare count.

## New Results
- Summary of ride-sharing data by city type


- Total weekly fares for each city type
