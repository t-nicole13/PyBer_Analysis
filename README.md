# Ride_Share_Analysis

## Objective

For this project, I analyzed data for ride sharing services to determine how often different types of cities use this service.  My goal is to figure out how ride sharing can be increased in underserved areas. 

### Tasks:
    - Analyzed all ride share data from Jan to early May 2019.
    - Created a visualization of my findings. (Matplotlib)
    - Created a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type. (Pandas)
    - Created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. (Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Resources

### Libraries
- Matplotlib 3.5.0 (graphing)
- Numpy 1.20.3 (numerical mathematics)
- Pandas 1.3.5 (data analysis)
- SciPy 1.7.3 (mathematical computing)

### Sofware 
- Python 3.7.11
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5

### Data
- city_data.csv
- ride_data.csv
- PyBer_ride_data.csv

## Results

 - Urban cities have the highest total number of drivers, total number of riders, and total fare price. 
 - Rural cities have a higher average fare price.
 - Rural cities have the lowest driver count, rider count, and total fare price.




### Total Weekly Fares For Each City Type

- Urban cities have the highest total fares per week and the lowest average fare per ride ($24.53).
- Rural cities have the lowest total fares per week and the higest average fare per ride ($34.62)

## Analysis On How We Can Increase Ride Sharing 
- We could increase the total number of rides in rural cities by decreasing the fare price.
- We could increase the total number of rides in rural cities by increasing the total number of drivers in rural areas.
- Since urban cities are usually more densely populated, we could decrease the fare price and maybe more people will use ride sharing services.
